# Fuzzy-Keyword-Search

Our project aims to implement an algorithm which is able to search through fuzzy (misspelled) keywords over the encrypted data on a cloud based system, in an
efficient way. By delivering the matching files when users' searching inputs precisely match the preset keywords or the closest feasible matching files based on keyword
similarity semantics, when exact match fails, fuzzy keyword search significantly improves system usability.
